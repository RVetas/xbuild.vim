# xbuild.vim

**xbuild.vim** is a lightweight Vim plugin that helps iOS developers build, test, and run their Xcode projects directly from within Vim using `xcodebuild`.

## üöÄ Features

Run common development tasks without leaving Vim:

| Command                   | Description                                                                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:XWorkspace`             | Automatically finds and sets the `.xcworkspace` for the current project.        |
| `:XScheme`                | Select a build scheme (`-scheme`).                                              |
| `:XDestination`           | Choose a destination (`-destination`) for building, testing, or running.        |
| `:XBuild`                 | Builds the current project using the selected scheme and destination.           |
| `:XTest`                  | Runs tests using the selected scheme and destination.                           |
